      The template first needs to be used for a web app for Safran aeronautics company. 
      This app, called eMonthly, helps Safran employees to input and to consult the evualuation marks for the quality of the services offered to their customers.</span>

       I add references to libraries that our centre has interest in using based on recurent feedback from clients. 
       I especially add Angular Material to make rapidly and efficiently a neat website design (in particular for PoCs) 
       and Kendo for Angular to be able to use grid systems that are a usual request from clients.</span>

  <p i18n="eMonthly span5|The fifth span of the eMonthly article@@eMonthlySpan5">Once this template project is operational, I work on the specificities of the application for Safran. 
    I note the interest of a built-in solution which is ready, modular and reusable in the future. 
    Then I easily integrate some screens asked in the specifications using Angular Material and Kendo already configured.</p>
  <p i18n="eMonthly span6|The sixth span of the eMonthly article@@eMonthlySpan6">I expect to work again on the Angular project template to improve it based on the needs of the future clients. 
    I also want to make it more accessible and modular for the future developers that will use it, even if they are new to Angular, 
    to encourage them to use good conception practices from the beginning.</p>
