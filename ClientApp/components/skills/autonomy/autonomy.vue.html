        <div>
            Galt is a package manager allowing developpers to watch and administrate the dependencies architecture of their .NET projects hosted on NuGet.
            <br />
            <br />
            The idea rises in 2016 from one of my school teachers in his small IT company, Signature Code.
            He wants to create a tool allowing his employees to easily manage all the packages used by their applications.
            The objective is to visualize a project dependencies as a tree, to be warned when a new package version is released
            and to be alerted in the case of a versions conflict.
            <br />
            <br />
            One of my classmate joins Signature Code in February for an internship during one month.
            He works on a POC (proof of concept) along with other employees of the company.
            The first version of the project works, even though it has limited functionnalities and a poor user interface.
            That's why our teacher decides to make a second version of the application.
            As a school project, he proposes the idea to my team, which is composed by Thibaud who already worked on the project and two others classmates.
            <br />
            <br />
            We start the project in October 2016. We decide to use adapted technologies for a user-friendly interface and a efficient packages management.
            Back end is managed by <b>ASP.NET MVC 5</b> and front end by <b>Vue.js</b>, a javascript framework which is released two weeks before.
            To display dependencies graphes, we decide to use a powerful graphic framework, <b>d3.js</b>.
            These technologies offer us many possibilities. However, they are new to us besides being recent then not much documented.
            <br />
            <br />
            During the project, I am mainly in charge of the front end with Vue.js.
            This framework belongs to the three main javascript web frameworks along with Angular (Google) and React (Facebook),
            unlike it is developped by an independent team.
            My teammates are being affected other tasks: one of them manages the creating and displaying of the dependencies graphes with d3.js,
            another one works on the back end and the last one make the bindings between front and back end 
            and is a technical reinforcment for the other members of the team.
            <br />
            <br />
            I suggest to my team to build an <b>SPA</b> (single page application) containing the different pages necessary for the application
            (home, sign up/sign in, search, graph, etc.).
            All the SPA is then sent to the back end.
            Our ASP.NET server displays a web page containing only a reference to our SPA in charge of the user interaction
            (<i>ed:</i> it is now possible to easily integrate directly Vue.js in an ASP.NET web application since Core versions
            - besides this site has been made with .NET Core 2 and Vue.js 2).
            <br />
            <br />
            Before starting the SPA creation, I begin with creating detailed mockups of each "page" from our application using Moqups tool.
            It is an important step, in particular when building SPAs, because pages are entirely modular.
            It is necessary to precisely define <b>UX</b> (user experience) and <b>UI</b> (user interface) to have a direction to follow during implementation.
            <br />
            <br />
            I learn the architecture and the functionment of a web framework with online training and with one of my teammates who already experienced Vue.js.
            It is a powerful tool allowing us to create fluid and user-friendly interfaces
            and to display the application pages created by reusable elements in order to make a completely modular app.
            <br />
            <br />
            After four months, we achieve the objectives established during our pre-project phase, which are:
            <ul>
                <li>Display a dependencies graph for a package hosted on NuGet retrieved using a search bar.</li>
                <li>Display the different versions available for this package, the potential new versions of the dependencies
                    and the potential conflicts of versions within the dependencies.</li>
                <li>Allow the user to create an account to save the packages he consulted recently and the favorite packages.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            My team presents the project during a forum of IT projects in my school in January 2017.
            We know that the presentation will be hard because our project is quite technical and aims a technical audience.
            Though we succeed in making it accessible for a large audience so our jury understand the stakes of our project.
            Among the jury, some of the members have a technical background and ask detailed questions about the functionment of our application,
            especially how we handled the package dependencies.
            Some other ones ask for the possible evolutions and improvements on the project. 
            These improvments are the secondary objectives we defined in the case we had still time before the forum:
            <ul>
                <li>Extend the packages management to hosting platforms other than NuGet (npm, Maven, gradle, etc.) using interfaces in our backend.</li>
                <li>Optimize the packages download (as some packages can need several minutes), especially by suggesting background download options.</li>
                <li>Add the possibility to upload your own package without using a hosting platform.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            This project was a great benefit for me on the technical side as well as the human side.
            I discovered several very recent technologies that I used again on my other projects.
            I have been able to answer the need of a customer (my teacher) and to end a project in its whole (the site has been deployed on our school server).
            I also took part in the organization of a complex project and I improved my oral expression
            during the presentation at the forum in front of a jury who did not necessary have a technical background.
